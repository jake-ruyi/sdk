# Ruyi OS

The operating system installed on the Ruyi console is a version of Windows 10 variably known as __Windows 10 IoT Enterprise__ or __Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016__.  Note that this is __not__ the same as [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot).   

Essentially, it is Windows 10:

* Fixed to RS1 update (aka Redstone 1, Anniversary Update, version 1607)
* With security features of Windows 10 Enterprise (i.e. [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/applocker/applocker-overview), [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview), and [Device Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/device-guard-deployment-guide))
* Without Microsoft Edge, Store, Cortana, and apps like Mail, Calendar, etc.

Together with our configuration, drivers, and shell it is __Ruyi OS__.

Some key changes we make relative to a normal Windows 10 environment:

* Drives (including `c:\`) encrypted with Bitlocker
* Numerous key combinations disabled (`Ctrl-Alt-Del`, `Alt-tab`, etc.)
* _UPCOMING_ Windows desktop shell replaced with Ruyi client UI
* _UPCOMING_ Device Guard Code Integrity enabled (now called Application Control)

A standard Windows Desktop environment is available via [PC mode](pc_mode.md).

## Installation

![](/docs/img/warning.png) Flash the correct BIOS version __before__ installing the corresponding OS version (see [BIOS](bios.md)).

The OS is always installed to the [primary drive](harddrive.md).

Installation should take 20-40 minutes.

1. Prepare bootable USB drive with at least __6__ GB space and FAT32 format
1. Download [Ruyi OS image](http://dev.playruyi.com/uservices)
    - We only provide a link to the latest version.  If you need an older version, contact [support](support.md).
1. Unzip OS files to root of bootable USB drive.  It should be similar to the following:  

        │   bootmgr
        │   bootmgr.efi
        │
        ├───Boot
        │   │   BCD
        │   │   boot.sdi
        │   │   bootfix.bin
        │   │   memtest.exe
        │   ├───Resources
        │
        ├───sources
        │       boot.wim
        │       dd.wim
        │       install.swm
        │       install2.swm
        │
        └───EFI
            ├───Boot
            │   │   bootx64.efi
            │   │   RUYIboot.efi

1. Once copying/unzipping is finished, eject/unmount the USB drive.  Then plug the USB drive into the machine it should be installed to, and reboot that machine.
1. A Command Prompt should appear, wait while the OS installs
1. When prompted, remove the USB drive and press `Enter` to reboot and continue
    - During the remainder of the installation process the machine may reboot, open PowerShell/Command Prompt windows, or display a black screen several times
1. Once a Windows desktop with no visible applications appears, installation is complete
