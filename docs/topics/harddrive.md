# Hard Drive

Ruyi has two drive bays for 2.5" SATA drives (max 9.5mm height):

* The drive in the center of the device is the _primary_ drive and __must__ be present as Ruyi always boots from this drive.
* The other drive is the _secondary_ drive and is optional.

Early Ruyi devkits shipped with a single Toshiba HDD.

Later Ruyi devkits shipped with a 128 GB SSD and 1 TB HDD.

Partitioning scheme between [RuyiOS](os.md) and [PC mode](pc_mode.md):
