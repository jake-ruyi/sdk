# Developer Tools

Similer to [layer0](layer0.md), the developer tools are designed as an executable with multiple feature plugins (found in the `Plugins/` folder).  The following executables exist:

| Executable | Details | Image
|-|-|-
| RuyiDev.exe | Double-click or run _without_ an argument | ![](/docs/img/ruyidev_gui.png)
| RuyiDev.exe | Run with any argument (e.g. `RuyiDev.exe -h`) | ![](/docs/img/ruyidev_cli.png)
| RuyiShell.exe | CLI only

## Plugins

All plugins are used via `RuyiDev.exe <plugin> <arguments>`.
Assistance for any plugin is available via `RuyiDev.exe <plugin> -h`.

| Name | Functionality
