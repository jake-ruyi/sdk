# Simulation Systems

![](/docs/img/warning.png) NOTICE  
Building a simulation system is no longer recommended and this will be removed in the future.  Use actual console hardware.

A _simulation system_ is a standard PC with hardware similar to the console.

Below follows suggestions and instructions for building a simluation system.

## Recommended Hardware

- [RX470](http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/radeon-rx-series/radeon-rx-470)
- [Ryzen 1400](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-1400)
- 6 to 8 GB DDR4 2400

### Differences from Ruyi Console

- Ruyi's APU will be clocked differently (CPU 3Gz, GPU 1.2GHz), but otherwise similar feature-wise
- Ruyi has 8 GB GDDR5 of shared system memory with 2GB reserved for the GPU

## Software

Ruyi platform can be installed to a PC.  By default it includes:

- [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](os.md)
- [Client software](layer0.md)
- Device drivers for console hardware

### Instructions

1. Consult manufacturer documentation to configure system BIOS:
    - Enable TPM (either iTPM of dTPM)
    - Enable Intel VT-x / AMD-V (or SVM) virtualization
    - Enable UEFI boot
    - Enable Secure boot
    - Boot from USB before HDD
1. Follow Ruyi OS [installation instructions](os.md#Installation)
1. __Optional__  Install any needed device drivers or 3rd-party software

### Ruyi Client

Ruyi client-side software should be copied from [SDK](sdk.md) to `c:\ruyi`:

- Layer0
- MainClient

See [SDK setup tutorial](../tutorials/setup.md).
