# AMD GPU Services (AGS)

[AMD GPU Services (AGS)](https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/amd-gpu-services-ags-library/) library provides access to hardware/software functionality not available through standard APIs.  This includes:

* AMD's [Graphic Core Next (GCN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next) shader extensions
    * Including [wavefront-wide functions](https://gpuopen.com/gcn-shader-extensions-for-direct3d-and-vulkan/)
* DirectX 11 and 12 extensions
* And more

Being an AMD platform, AGS should work on Ruyi.

## Getting Started

AMD's engineers recommend taking a look at the [Barycentrics12 sample](https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/barycentrics12-dx12-gcnshader-ext-sample/) ([Github](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/Barycentrics12/)).
