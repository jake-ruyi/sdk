# Package File Preparation

1. Create the Manifest file, It must be named RuyiManifest.json, an typical content should looks like:
```
     {
        appID: "app_id",                                                        A
        application:    {
                name:"@app_id",                                                 B
                label:"@antestapp",
                icon:"bluetooth.png",
                description:"an test app description",
                logo:"logo.png",
                activity:[
                        {
                                name:"main",
                                exePath:"space_shooter/space_shooter.exe",      C
                                label:"main test activity",
                                description:"@antestapp",
                                icon:"logo.png"
                        }
                ]
        },
        use_permissions:[
                {
                        name:"jade.permission.ACHIEVEMENT"
                }
        ],
        use_sdk:{
                minSdkVersion : "1.0.0.0"
        }
    }
```  A  appID: "app_id" app_idd is the appid Ruyi give the developers(ep.10112)
     B  name:"@app_id" @app_id is the localization key in ret/i18n.json
     C  exePath:"space_shooter/space_shooter.exe" is the file path of exe file  
2. Create an sibling folder named "res" with your manifest file
3. create "ld" and "hd" folder in "res", put your images used in the manifest file into them according to the "high" or "low" dimension.
4. create the i18n.json file in "res", which should contain texts in all language you're gonna support. it should looks like this:
```
    {
        "i18n": {
            "en-US": {
                "trc.item.succeed": "pass",
                "antestapp": "achievement max number allowed for each title",
                "com.ruyi.TestApp": "against every game, we only allow specific number of achievement to be created"
            },
            "zh-CN": {
                "trc.item.succeed": "测试通过",
                "antestapp": "每款APP所允许的最大的成就数量"
            }
        }
    }
```
5. put your game files in the same folder with "res" folder and RuyiManifest.json, remember the exe file path of your game should
   match "C" part in 1.
6. create a zip file named "app_id" and contain all the content above directly in the root
